# The Project
{{<youtubeLite id="x_jSc3lhYfI" label="ARPG template - Skillable entities">}}

This project is my playground, I use it for experimenting, R&D, and to develop new libraries. 
Everything I work on in this project eventually makes its way to a plugin.

The idea was originally to create a framework for a game that mixed Old School Runescape with Diablo 2. 
The template uses the Gameplay Ability System for all of its gameplay effects and abilities. 

The Context-based action system I designed allows every entity to have a context action hierarchy based on its available GameplayTags.
