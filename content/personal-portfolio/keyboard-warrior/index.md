# The Project
{{<youtubeLite id="S0hpepWO5mk" label="Keyboard Warrior demo">}}

Keyboard Warriors is a 2.5D roguelite typing game that with questing and turn based combat.

The game originally started off as a game jam project in 2020. The original concept was a 1v1 PVP typing game where wizards have to type incantations to cast spells and win the battle. 

## Tools used  

**Game Engine**: Unity  
**VCS**: Git  
**Art**: Photoshop, Aseprite

## My part 

As the sole developer on the project, my responsibilities included:
- Art
- Developing the combat system
- Level generation
- UI/UX
- 3C programming
- Creating all the systems for questing, and roguelike mechanics
- Building the typing system 


## Development cycle

### The original concept

{{<youtubeLite id="6SE63pABT4A" label="Initial concept">}}
The original concept for Keyboard Warriors was a 1v1 PVP match where wizards cast spells at each other. The idea was that this represents an "internet argument".

### Iterating on the concept

{{<youtubeLite id="Y6Sw-wYLf38" label="Adding turn based combat">}}
This version went further into the "Internet argument" idea and attempted to be closer to a typing turn based game. This is also where I added different character types, as the idea was to have multiple archtypes. 

### Changing directions - Questing
{{<youtubeLite id="cL_zfX2u6xc" label="Questing">}}
I eventually pivoted the idea to be a top down 2.5D roguelite game. This video shows the questing system. 

### Changing directions - Adding ability queueing

Finally, I added queueing abilities, allowing you to execute multiple abilities on your turn.
